Assignment: Multiplication of Two 16-bit Numbers in Assembly Language
Background:
Understanding how to perform arithmetic operations on data sizes larger than what a microcontroller 
natively supports is a fundamental skill in embedded systems programming. The 8051 microcontroller 
is an 8-bit device, but it is often required to handle 16-bit (or larger) numbers in various applications.
Objective:
Write an assembly language program for the 8051 microcontroller to perform the multiplication of two 
16-bit numbers. The multiplication should be carried out manually, as the 8051 does not have direct 
support for 16-bit multiplication.
Task Breakdown:
1. Initialization:
 - Store two 16-bit numbers in registers. For example, you can use `R0:R1` to store the first number 
and `R2:R3` for the second number. Ensure that the higher byte is stored in the lower register (e.g., 
`R0` and `R2`).
2. Multiplication Logic:
 - Use the `MUL AB` instruction to perform 8-bit multiplication operations on parts of the 16-bit 
numbers.
 - Handle carries and intermediate sums properly to construct the final result.
3. Storing the Result:
 - Store the result across four memory locations or registers.
4. Considerations:
 - Pay attention to the order of operations to ensure the accuracy of the multiplication.
 - Be careful with the handling of carries between the different stages of the multiplication.
Guidelines:
- Clearly comment on each step in your code to explain the logic and the purpose of the operations.
- Optimize for readability and efficiency.
- You may test your program with different 16-bit numbers to ensure its correctness.
Testing:
- Test your program with the provided numbers (`5678h` and `1234h`) and verify that the result is 
stored correctly across the four memory locations or registers.
- Conduct additional tests with different sets of numbers to further validate your program.
Certainly! Here's a grading rubric for the assignment involving the multiplication of two 16-bit 
numbers on an 8051 microcontroller:
Grading Criteria:
Total Points: 100
1. Correct Implementation of Multiplication Logic (40 points):
 - Correctly loading the 16-bit numbers into registers (10 points)
 - Proper execution of 8-bit multiplication operations and handling of partial results (20 points)
 - Accurate accumulation and storage of the final result in memory or registers (10 points)
2. Handling of Carries and Intermediate Sums (30 points):
 - Correct handling of carries during addition of partial results (15 points)
 - Accurate calculation of intermediate sums (15 points)
3. Register and Memory Utilization (15 points):
 - Efficient use of registers for storing temporary and intermediate results (10 points)
 - Appropriate use of memory locations for storing the final result (5 points)
4. Code Efficiency and Style (10 points):
 - Efficient use of instructions without redundancy (5 points)
 - Readability and clarity of the code, including indentation, labelling, and comments (5 points)
5. Testing and Documentation (5 points):
 - Providing a test plan or script with different sets of numbers (3 points)
 - Correct output for provided test cases and additional numbers (2 points)
Bonus/Extra Credit (Up to 5 points):
 - Optimization of the multiplication routine for speed or memory efficiency (up to 3 points)
 - Exceptional documentation and presentation of testing methodology and results (up to 2 points
